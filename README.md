## Splash Screen

Starting with this version, a custom SwiftUI-based splash screen is used instead of a LaunchScreen storyboard.

- **SplashScreenView.swift** shows:
  - App title
  - App version
  - App icon (`mbk-icon-1024`)
- Displays for 2â€“3 seconds before transitioning to the main view
- No storyboard or LaunchScreen.storyboard is used

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Make sure **Assets.xcassets** includes the following:
   - `mbk-icon-1024` (App icon for splash screen)
3. Build and run the project.
4. The app will display a splash screen before launching into the main dashboard.

---

## Notes

- Ensure the image `mbk-icon-1024` is added inside **Assets.xcassets**.
- If you get an error like `No image named 'mbk-icon-1024' found`, clean build folder (`Shift + Cmd + K`) and rebuild (`Cmd + B`).
- Mac apps do not use a real launch screen by default; the splash is manually shown with SwiftUI.
